# AddressBook
Address book for exercise.

Good good study, day day up.

Before you run this Single Page Application, you have to install `webpack-dev-server` firstly.

```
npm install webpack-dev-server -g
```

Then you can type a command in the root path:

```
webpack-dev-server
``` 

Now, you can type `localhost:8080` in browser to see the Address Book.
